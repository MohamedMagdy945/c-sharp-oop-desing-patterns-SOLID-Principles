# Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

##  What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is one of the four fundamental principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
It is the concept of **hiding implementation details** and exposing only the essential features of an object.  

In simple terms:  
> **"Show what an object can do, not how it does it."**

##  Why Abstraction is Important
- **Reduce Complexity**: Focuses on what the object does instead of how it is implemented.
- **Maintainability**: Internal changes do not affect dependent code.
- **Loose Coupling**: Code depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
- **Scalability**: Makes systems easier to extend and modify.
- **Clarity**: Improves readability and understanding of the code.

##  How Abstraction Works in C#
- Use **interfaces** to define behavior without implementation.
- Use **abstract classes** to define shared behavior and abstract methods.
- Interact with objects through **abstract types** instead of concrete classes.
