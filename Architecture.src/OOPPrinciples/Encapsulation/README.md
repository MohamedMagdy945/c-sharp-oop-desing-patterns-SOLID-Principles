# Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

##  What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
It is the concept of **hiding the internal details of an object** and exposing only what is necessary through a controlled interface.  

In simple terms:  
> **"Keep the data safe, and provide controlled access to it."**

##  Why Encapsulation is Important
- **Data Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access or modification of internal object data.
- **Maintainability**: Internal implementation can change without affecting other parts of the program.
- **Control**: You can enforce rules when setting or getting values.
- **Flexibility**: Allows adding validation, logging, or other logic when accessing data.

##  How Encapsulation Works in C#
- Use **private fields** to store data.
- Provide **public methods or properties** to access or modify the data safely.
