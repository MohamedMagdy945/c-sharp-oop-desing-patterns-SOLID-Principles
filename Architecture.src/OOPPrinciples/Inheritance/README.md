# Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is one of the core principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
It is the concept of **creating a new class based on an existing class**, allowing the new class to reuse, extend, or modify the behavior of the existing class.  

In simple terms:  
> **"Build on existing functionality without rewriting it."**

## Why Inheritance is Important
- **Code Reusability**: Enables reusing existing code in new classes.  
- **Extensibility**: Allows adding new features to a class without modifying the original class.  
- **Polymorphism Support**: Makes it possible to treat objects of different derived classes as objects of the base class.  
- **Maintainability**: Changes in the base class can propagate to derived classes, simplifying updates.

## How Inheritance Works
- Define a **base class** that contains common properties and behaviors.  
- Create **derived classes** that inherit from the base class.  
- Derived classes can access the **public** or **protected members** of the base class.  
- You can **override or extend behaviors** in the derived classes to customize functionality.
