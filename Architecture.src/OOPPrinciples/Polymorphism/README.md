# Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism is a fundamental principle of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
It is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a **common base class**, 
while each object can respond differently to the same method call.  

In simple terms:  
> **"One interface, many forms."**

## Why Polymorphism is Important
- **Flexibility**: Allows writing code that works with objects of different types through a common interface.  
- **Extensibility**: New classes can be added without changing existing code that uses polymorphism.  
- **Maintainability**: Reduces conditional statements and simplifies code structure.  
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Objects can decide at runtime which behavior to execute.

---

## How Polymorphism Works
- Define a **base class** or **interface** with methods that can be overridden.  
- Create **derived classes** that implement or override these methods.  
- The program can call the same method on different objects, and each object responds according to its own class implementation.  
- Supports both **compile-time (method overloading)** and **runtime (method overriding)** polymorphism.

## Key Points
- Polymorphism enables **code generalization** and **reuse**.  
- It is closely related to **inheritance** and **abstraction**.  
- Proper use of polymorphism simplifies complex programs and enhances **object-oriented design**.
