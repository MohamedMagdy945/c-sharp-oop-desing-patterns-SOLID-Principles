#  C# Architecture Masterclass
### Mastering OOP, SOLID, and Design Patterns in .NET

---

##  Overview
This repository is a high-level **educational laboratory** and a **reference guide** for C# developers. It is designed to bridge the gap between "writing code that works" and "architecting software that lasts." 

The project provides a clear roadmap from basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to advanced **Design Patterns**, all while strictly adhering to **SOLID Principles** and modern **Design Philosophy**.

---

##  Project Objectives
* **Architectural Thinking:** Learn to see software as a set of interacting components, not just lines of code.
* **Clean Code Evolution:** Demonstrate "Before" (Spaghetti) and "After" (Refactored) versions of common logic.
* **Scalability:** Build systems that can grow without breaking existing features.
* **Industry Standards:** Implement patterns used in enterprise-level applications.

##  The Knowledge Stack

### 🔹 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
The four pillars that form the foundation:
* **Encapsulation:** Protecting data integrity via access modifiers and properties.
* **Abstraction:** Reducing complexity by hiding implementation details.
* **Inheritance:** Facilitating code reuse and hierarchical relationships.
* **Polymorphism:** Enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.

### 🔹 2. Design Principles (The Philosophy)
Essential rules for clean software engineering:
* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Minimizing redundancy in logic.
* **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Avoiding over-engineering.
* **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Implementing only what is necessary.
* **Composition Over Inheritance:** Preferring flexible object composition.
* **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** Dividing a program into distinct sections.

### 🔹 3. SOLID Principles
The five rules for robust Class Design:
* **S - Single Responsibility:** One class, one reason to change.
* **O - Open/Closed:** Open for extension, closed for modification.
* **L - Liskov Substitution:** Subclasses must be substitutable for base classes.
* **I - Interface Segregation:** Prefer thin, specific interfaces.
* **D - Dependency Inversion:** Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

### 🔹 4. Design Patterns Catalog
| Creational | Structural | Behavioral |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  Singleton |  Adapter |  Strategy |
|  Factory Method |  Decorator |  Observer |
|  Builder |  Facade |  Command |
|  Abstract Factory |  Proxy |  State |
